  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 123 * n + 17 = 39500) : n = 321 := by
  have h₁ : n = 321 := by
    -- We need to solve the equation 123n + 17 = 39500 for n.
    -- First, we isolate the term with n by subtracting 17 from both sides.
    -- 123n + 17 - 17 = 39500 - 17
    -- 123n = 39483
    -- Next, we divide both sides by 123 to solve for n.
    -- n = 39483 / 123
    -- We calculate 39483 / 123 to find n.
    -- 39483 / 123 = 321
    -- Therefore, n = 321.
