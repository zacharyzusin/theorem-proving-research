  -- We need to find x + y + z, which is 12.
  -- We will use the given equations to solve for x, y, and z.
  -- From the first equation: 3x + y = 17
  -- From the second equation: 5y + z = 14
  -- From the third equation: 3x + 5z = 41
  -- We will use these equations to find the value of x + y + z.
