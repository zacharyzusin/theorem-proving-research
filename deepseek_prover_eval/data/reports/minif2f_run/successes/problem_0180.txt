  (a d : ℝ)
  (h₀ : a + 6 * d = 30)
  (h₁ : a + 10 * d = 60) :
  a + 20 * d = 135 := by
  have h₂ : a + 20 * d = 135 := by
    -- We use the given equations to solve for d and then substitute back to find a.
    -- From the first equation, we can express a in terms of d:
    -- a = 30 - 6d
    -- Substitute this expression into the second equation:
    -- (30 - 6d) + 10d = 60
    -- Simplify to find d:
    -- 30 + 4d = 60
    -- 4d = 30
    -- d = 7.5
    -- Substitute d back into the expression for a:
    -- a = 30 - 6 * 7.5 = 30 - 45 = -15
    -- Finally, calculate a + 20d:
    -- a + 20d = -15 + 20 * 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135
