  (a b c : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c)
  (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
  (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) :
  63 * a = 80 * c := by
  have h₃ : 0 < b := by linarith
  have h₄ : 0 < c := by linarith
  have h₅ : 0 < a := by linarith
  -- We need to show that 63 * a = 80 * c
  -- We have the equations 9 * b = 20 * c and 7 * a = 4 * b
  -- Solve for b in terms of c from the first equation: b = (20/9) * c
  -- Substitute b into the second equation: 7 * a = 4 * (20/9) * c
  -- Simplify to find a in terms of c: a = (80/63) * c
  -- Finally, substitute a into the expression for 63 * a: 63 * a = 63 * (80/63) * c = 80 * c
