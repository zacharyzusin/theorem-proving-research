  -- We use the given conditions to solve for the coefficients a and b.
  -- From f(7) = 4, we have 7a + b = 4.
  -- From f(6) = 3, we have 6a + b = 3.
  -- Subtract the second equation from the first to find a = 1.
  -- Substitute a = 1 into 6a + b = 3 to find b = -3.
  -- Finally, compute f(3) = 3a + b = 3(1) - 3 = 0.
