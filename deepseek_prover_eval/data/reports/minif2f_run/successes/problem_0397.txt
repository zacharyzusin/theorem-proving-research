theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  rw [Nat.properDivisors]
  -- We need to show that the sum of the proper divisors of 198 is 270.
  -- The proper divisors of 198 are all the divisors of 198 except 198 itself.
  -- We will use the fact that the sum of the divisors of 198 is 468, and we need to subtract 198.
  rfl
  -- This is a placeholder for the actual proof, which would involve detailed calculations of the divisors and their sums.
