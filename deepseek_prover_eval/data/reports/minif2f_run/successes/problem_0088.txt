    -- We need to show that n is at least 6710.
    -- Since 1342 divides n, we can write n = 1342 * k for some integer k.
    -- The remainder r when n is divided by 13 is less than r.
    -- We need to find the smallest n such that n ≥ 6710.
    -- We use the fact that 1342 % 13 = 12 and the smallest n is 6710.
