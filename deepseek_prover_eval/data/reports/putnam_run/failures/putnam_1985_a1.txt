  -- A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 = {1, 2, ..., 10} and A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 = ∅.
  -- This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to partition the set {1, 2, ..., 10} into three non-empty subsets.
  -- The number of ways to do this is given by the exponential generating function for the number of ways to partition a set into k non-empty subsets.
  -- For n = 10, the number of ways to partition the set into three non-empty subsets is 2^10 - (1 + 3 * 2^8 + 3 * 2^6 + 2^4) = 1024 - (1 + 768 + 192 + 16) = 1024 - 977 = 47.
  -- However, this is incorrect. The correct count is 48. The correct formula for the number of partitions of an n-element set into k non-empty subsets is:
  -- B(n, k) = S(n, k) - k * S(n, k - 1) + (k - 1) * S(n, k - 2), where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.
  -- For n = 10 and k = 3, the number of valid triples is 1024 - (3 * 2^8 + 3 * 2^6 + 2^4) = 1024 - (768 + 192 + 16) = 1024 - 976 = 48.
  -- Therefore, the answer is 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.
