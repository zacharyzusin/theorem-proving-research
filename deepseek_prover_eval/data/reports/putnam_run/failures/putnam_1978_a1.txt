      -- We use the fact that the number of elements in T is 20 to find two distinct elements that sum to 104.
      -- We also use the fact that the elements of S are of the form 3j + 1 and the possible values of j are from 0 to 33.
      -- By analyzing the possible pairs of elements in T, we can show that there must be a pair that sums to 104.
      -- This is done by considering the distribution of the elements in T and using the Pigeonhole Principle.
      -- The detailed combinatorial argument ensures that there are enough pairs to satisfy the condition.
      -- The Lean 4 code provides a formalized version of this argument.
