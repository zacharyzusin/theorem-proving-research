(S : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℕ))
(hS : ∀ A ∈ S, ∀ i j : Fin 2, (∃ x : ℤ, A i j = x ^ 2) ∧ A i j ≤ 200)
: (S.encard > 50387) → (∃ A ∈ S, ∃ B ∈ S, A ≠ B ∧ A * B = B * A) := by

  have h₁ := hS
  have h₂ := h
  -- Use the fact that the number of possible matrices is limited by the constraints on the entries.
  -- This is a combinatorial argument to show that if S has more than 50387 elements, then it must contain duplicates or non-commuting pairs.
